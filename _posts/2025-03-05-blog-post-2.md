Transformers have revolutionized NLP, powering models like GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek. But what makes them so effective? The answer lies in their **attention mechanism**, which enables models to focus on relevant information rather than processing everything equally.  

In this blog, weâ€™ll **dissect the Transformer architecture**, exploring its evolution from SEQ2SEQ models to Bahdanau Attention and cutting-edge techniques like **Multihead and Cross Attention**. By the end, youâ€™ll have a strong understanding of **how attention works, why itâ€™s crucial, and how it enables modern LLMs**.
