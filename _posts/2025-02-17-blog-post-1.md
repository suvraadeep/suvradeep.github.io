Ever wondered how large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 understand text? Well, they donâ€™tâ€”at least, not like humans do! Instead, they break text down into **tokens**, the fundamental building blocks of all AI-generated language.  

In this blog, Iâ€™ll dive deep into **tokenization**, the first and most crucial step in the LLM pipeline. From Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to WordPiece, Iâ€™ll cover the **why, how, and what** of tokenizersâ€”so you can truly grasp how LLMs process text, one token at a time.
