Cool! So this is my very first blog where I’ll share everything I know about tokenizers. I’ve reviewed other blogs on the topic, but none seemed as comprehensive as the one I’m about to present.  

By the end of this, you’ll have a solid understanding of the first step in the LLM pre-training lifecycle — **tokenization**. Without this crucial step, developing LLMs would be incredibly challenging :)  

And I must admit, I’m writing for a selfish purpose — it’s for my own learning. As Feynman said, *when you teach, you learn better.*  

For reference, I have used:  
- [Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation](https://www.amazon.in/Hands-Large-Language-Models-Understanding/dp/1098150961)  
- [Building LLM from Scratch Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTV0NXA_ZSgsLAr8YCgCwhPIJNNtexWu&si=R4L7305IMJRb73vl)  


Headings are cool
