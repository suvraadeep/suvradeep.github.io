## More of Me 
I am a pre-final year student in Biosciences and Bioengineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, deeply passionate about Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Large Language Models (LLMs). My expertise lies in developing and fine-tuning LLMs, dataset design, and chatbot development, along with working on real-world AI applications.  I have a strong foundation in data science and have completed various projects, including research internships at two major universities. As a Kaggle 2x Grandmaster (Top 0.01%, Global Rank <50), I actively contribute to the ML community. Additionally, I have mentored students globally through the Summer Analytics program at IIT Guwahati, which has over 4,000 registrations.  
Currently, I am exploring agentic AI, PPO, GRPO, and statistical learning while building end-to-end LLM applications. My research interests focus on leveraging language models for social good, ensuring AI benefits diverse communities.  
Beyond academics, I enjoy solving puzzles, engaging in thought-provoking discussions, and maintaining an active lifestyle through swimming. I also love sharing knowledge through blogs, helping others navigate the world of ML.
